      <h2 class="line-below text-center">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p class="question">How can I find out more information about these programs?</p>
<p class="answer">Simply click the program's title to be redirected to its website.</p>
<p class="question">Why are you doing this?</p>
<p class="answer">Many organizations offer free or subsidized summer programs for high schoolers, but in our experience, they disproportionately attract students whose guidance counselors have the time and resource to publicize such opportunities to their students. SummerSearch attempts to democratize access to free programs by aggregating them (alongside select paid programs) in a searchable, filterable database.</p>
<p class="question">Is SummerSearch affiliated with the programs on their website?</p>
<p class="answer">No, SummerSearch compiles third party programs for interested students. If you're aware of a program you think we should publicize, please share it with us using our submission form.</p>
<p class="question">Is SummerSearch meant for a specific demographic?</p>
<p class="answer">SummerSearch is designed for an inclusive audience, and we hope that anyone in high school can find a program that reflects their interests, skills, and budget.</p>
<p class="question">Where do you find these programs?</p>
<p class="answer">Our team has worked hard to compile many of these programs through their own experiences and research. Additionally, we receive information about programs from individuals looking to help!</p>
<p class="question">Is SummerSearch free?</p>
<p class="answer">Yes, and SummerSearch will remain a free service--we only ask you to create accounts to help you track your favorite programs.</p>
